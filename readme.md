5. **Problem Statement and Motivation**

Problem Statement: Highlight the importance of real-time object detection and the limitations of traditional object detection methods. Discuss the need for a unified model that balances speed and accuracy.

Motivation: Real-time applications, such as autonomous vehicles and security systems, require efficient object detection. YOLO’s single-step detection offers a solution for these applications, providing a fast and generalizable model for real-time use.

6. **Background and Literature Review**

**Object Detection Overview**

Object detection identifies and localizes objects in images or videos. Traditional methods used sliding windows, like Haar Cascades and HOG. More recent deep learning methods, such as R-CNN and Faster R-CNN, improved accuracy but remained computationally heavy.

**Evolution of Object Detection Models**

	•	R-CNN (2014) and its variants introduced a region-based approach but were slow and resource-intensive.
	•	SSD (Single Shot Detector) offered faster detection by processing the image in one step.
	•	YOLO treats object detection as a regression problem, mapping pixels directly to bounding box coordinates and classes in one go, making it ideal for real-time applications.

**YOLO’s Unique Contribution**

YOLO’s single convolutional network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously, providing faster inference than region-based models and making it suitable for real-time applications.

7. **Conclusion**

This project will provide valuable insights into the YOLO object detection algorithm, comparing its performance with models like Faster R-CNN and SSD. YOLO’s speed and accuracy make it a potential solution for industries like autonomous vehicles, security, and healthcare.
